Suggestions and pull requests are welcomed! Feel free to open a discussion or an issue for a new feature request or bug.

One of the best ways to contribute is to grab a [bug report or feature suggestion](https://github.com/manuelernestog/astrofy/issues) that has been marked `accepted` and dig in.

Please be wary of working on issues _not_ marked as `accepted`. Just because someone has created an issue doesn't mean we'll accept a pull request for it.
